# Go Tests

## ðŸ“˜ Description
The Go-Tests repository provides an in-depth guide to writing and executing tests in the Go programming language. This repository is perfect for developers looking to master Goâ€™s testing framework through practical examples and well-structured code snippets.

Key topics covered:

- Unit Testing: Learn how to write and execute unit tests in Go.
- Test Functions: Understand how to structure test functions using Goâ€™s built-in testing package.
- Benchmarking: Explore performance testing with benchmarks.
- Table-Driven Tests: Implement flexible and scalable test cases using table-driven tests.
- Mocking and Assertions: Learn techniques to mock dependencies and assert expected outcomes.
- Test Organization: Structure tests effectively for maintainability.
